\section{Scattering data}

Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ denote by $\S M$ its unit tangent bundle
\[\S M=\set{\vec v\in \T M}{|v|=1}.\]
Recall that by \epmph{Liouville's theorem}, the geodesic flow $\phi^t$ preserves the natural volume on $\S M$ in its domain of definition.

Suppose $M$ has nonempty boundary $\partial M$;
in other words, $M$ is a closed region of an ambient Riemannian  manifold bounded by a smooth hypersurface $\partial M$.
Denote by $\S^+ \partial M$ the set of unit vectors at points on $\partial M$ that point in $M$;
$\S^+ \partial M$ is a bundle over $\partial M$ with fibers formed by closed half-spheres.

Consider a geodesic $\gamma_{\vec u}$ in the direction of a vector $\vec u\in \S^+ \partial M$.
Suppose that $\gamma_{\vec u}$ hits the boundary again; 
denote by $\ell(\vec u)$ the first \emph{hitting time}, so $\gamma_{\vec u}(\ell(\vec u))\in \partial M$.
Note that in this case the vector $\vec v=-\gamma'(\ell)$ lies in $\S^+ \partial M$.
Note that $\vec u\mapsto \vec v$ describes a partially defined involution on $\S M$ which we will call \emph{scattering map}.

Suppose that $M$ and $\bar M$ be two compact connected Riemannian manifolds with boundary such that a neighborhood of $\partial M$ can be isometrically identified with a neighborhood of $\partial \bar M$,
and moreover, the scattering maps in $M$ and $\bar M$ are identical.
In this case we say that $M$ and $\bar M$ have identical  \emph{scattering data}.
If in addition their hitting time functions  coincide (that is, if $\ell(\vec u)\equiv\bar\ell(\vec u)$), then we say that $M$ and $\bar M$ have the identical \emph{lens data}.

Notice that if a manifold contains a copy of a round hemispher, then cutting it and cluing the opposite points of its boundary produces a manifold with identical scattering data.

The lens data for the constructed pair of manifolds are not same.
An example of nonisometric manifolds with identical lens data can be found among surfaces of revolution which look like cylinders with bumps on them that are shifted and otherwise look the same.

\end{figure}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Check that the described examples have identical lens data.

Construct a nonisometric pair of Riemannian metrics on the disc with identical lens data.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:magic-cloak}
Any connected compact region $M$ of Euclidean space of dimension at least 2 cut by a smooth hypersurface is \emph{scattering rigid};
that is, any manifold with scattering data identical to $M$ is isometric to $M$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Suppose a Riemannian metric $g$ on $\RR^n$ coincides with Euclidean metric $g_0$ outside of a compact set $K$.
Suppose that that the complement $\gamma\backslash K$ of any nontrivial $g$-geodesic $\gamma$ coincides with the complement of a line (as sets).
Then $(\RR^n,g)$ is isometric to the Euclidean space.
\end{thm}

Note that one cannot claim that $g=g_0$.
Indeed for any diffeomorphism $\phi\:\RR^n\to\RR^n$ that is identical outside $K$ the metric $g=\phi_*g$ satisfies the assumption in the corollary.
Clearly one can choose $\phi$ so that $g\ne g_0$.


\section{Identical lens data}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:no-delay}
Suppose that a manifold $\bar M$ has identical scattering data with a compact region $M$ in Euclidean space of dimension at least 2.
Then $M$ and $\bar M$ have identical lens data. 
\end{thm}

The Euclidean space can be exchanged to a Riemannian manifold with unique geodesic between any pair of points; the proof is the same.

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $W$ the complement of the interior of $M$ in the Euclidean space $E$.
Note that we glue $\bar M$ to $W$ along the isometry in the definition of scattering data.
This way we obtain a complete Riemannian manifold $\bar E$ that is Euclidean outside of a $\bar M$.

Suppose that a smooth hypersurface $\Sigma$ in $E$ surrounds $M$.
Then $\Sigma$ cuts from $E$ and $\bar E$ manifolds with identical scattering data.
Moreover if $\bar M$ and $M$ are not isometric,
then the obtained pair is not isometric as well.

It follows that we can assume that $M$ is a ball.
(This is true for the proof of the lemma and theorem as well.)

In this case any geodesic $\bar\gamma$ in $\bar E$ visits $\bar M$ at most once.
In other words, if $\bar\gamma$ enters $\bar M$, then the complement $\bar\gamma\backslash \bar M$ has two connected components which are parts of a line $\gamma$ in $E$.

Choose a unit-speed geodesic $\bar\gamma$ that visits $\bar M$.
Let include it in a smooth one-parameter family of unit-speed geodescis $\bar\gamma_\tau$ for $\tau\in [0,1]$ so that $\bar\gamma_0$ does not visit $\bar M$ and $\bar \gamma_1=\bar \gamma$.

We can assume that 
the vector field $\bar{\vec i}
=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial\tau}\bar\gamma_\tau(t)$ is orthogonal to $\bar{\vec t}
=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\bar\gamma_\tau(t)$ at every point $\bar\gamma_\tau(t_0)$ for some fixed $t_0$.

Observe that in this case $\langle\bar{\vec i},\bar{\vec t}\rangle=0$ at all points $\bar\gamma_\tau(t)$.
Indeed 
\begin{align*}
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\langle\bar{\vec i},\bar{\vec t}\rangle&=
\bar{\vec t}\langle\bar{\vec i},\bar{\vec t}\rangle=
\\
&=
\langle\nabla_{\bar{\vec t}}\bar{\vec i},\bar{\vec t}\rangle+\cancel{\langle\bar{\vec i},\nabla_{\bar{\vec t}}\bar{\vec t}\rangle}=
\\
&=\langle\nabla_{\bar{\vec i}}\bar{\vec t},\bar{\vec t}\rangle=
\\
&=\tfrac12\cdot\bar{\vec i}\langle\bar{\vec t},\bar{\vec t}\rangle=
\\
&=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \tau}|\bar\gamma_\tau'(t)|^2=
\\
&=0.
\end{align*}
That is $\langle\bar{\vec i},\bar{\vec t}\rangle$ does not depend on $t$.
Since $\langle\bar{\vec i},\bar{\vec t}\rangle=0$ at all points $\bar\gamma_\tau(t_0)$, the same holds for all points  $\bar\gamma_\tau(t)$.

Consider a family of geodesics $\gamma_\tau$ in $E$ that coincide with $\bar\gamma_\tau$ (as sets) outside of $M$.
The same argument shows that $\langle\vec i,\vec t\rangle=0$ for the corresponding vector fields ${\vec i}
=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial\tau}\gamma_\tau(t)$ and $\vec t
=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\gamma_\tau(t)$
at all points $\gamma_\tau(t)$.

By assumption, $\bar{\vec t}=\vec t$ and
$\bar{\vec i}-\vec i$ is proprtional to $\vec t$ in $W$.
It follows that $\bar{\vec i}=\vec i$ in $W$.
Therefore $\gamma_\tau(t)=\bar\gamma_\tau(t)$ for any $t$ and $\tau$, provided that $\bar\gamma(t)\in W$.
Whence the $\gamma$ spends exactly the same time in $M$ as 
$\bar \gamma$ spends in $\bar M$ and the lemma follows.\qeds

\parit{Comment.}
The vector fields $\vec i$  as in the proof restricted to $\gamma_\tau$ describe a variation of a geodesics.
These fields are called \emph{Jacobi fields} along $\gamma_\tau$;
we will see them again.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:exit-time}
Suppose $\bar M$ and $\bar E$ be as in the proof.
Show that there is a universal upper bound on time that a unit-speed geodesic spends in $\bar M$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Hint:} Show that the set of vectors $\vec u\in\S \bar E$ such that the arc $\gamma_{\vec u}|_{[0, T]}$ lies in $\bar M$ is open and closed;
here $T=2\cdot\diam M$ and $\gamma_{\vec u}$ is the geodesic defined by $\gamma'_{\vec u}(0)=\vec u$.

\section{Volume equality}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:vol=}
Suppose that a manifold $\bar M$ has identical scattering data with a compact region $M$ in Euclidean space of dimension at least 2.
Then 
\[\vol M=\vol \bar M.\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Recall that $\bar s\:\S \bar M\to \bar M$ denotes the unit tangent bundle over $\bar M$
and $\bar\phi^t\:\S \bar M\to \S \bar M$ denotes the geodesic flow.

Set $\bar\Omega=\bar s^{-1}(\bar M)$.
Since geodesic flow preserves the volume, we get 
\begin{align*}
\vol\SSS^{n-1}\cdot\vol(\bar M,g)&=\vol\bar\Omega=
\\
&=\vol[\bar\phi^t(\bar\Omega)].
\end{align*}

By \ref{ex:exit-time}, we can choose $t$ so that $s(\vec v)\notin \bar M$ for any $\vec v\in \phi^t(\bar\Omega)$.

Repeat the same construction for $M$. 
By \ref{lem:no-delay}, $\phi^t(\Omega)\z=\bar\phi^t(\bar\Omega)$.
In particular, 
\[
\vol\Omega=
\vol[\phi^t(\Omega)]=
\vol[\bar\phi^t(\bar\Omega)]=
\vol\bar\Omega.
\]
whence the result follows.

\section{Santal\'{o} formula}

Santal\'{o} formula is a simple corollary the Liouville's theorem --- geodesic flow preserves the volume.
It gives an expression for a volume of a Riemannian manifold with boundary in terms of hitting times of its geodesics.
It provides a more direct proof of \ref{lem:vol=}.

Suppose $M$ is a Reimannian manifold with nonempty boundary $\partial M$.
Recall that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\S M$ denotes the unit tangent bundle over $M$.
\item $\S^+ \partial M$ denotes by the bundle of unit vectors at points on $\partial M$ that point in $M$.
\item $\ell\:\S^+ \partial M\to [0,\infty]$ denoted the hitting time.
\end{itemize}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonempty boundary.
Suppose that any unit-speed geodesic in $M$ hits its boundary in finite time.
Then for any smooth function $f\:\S M\to\RR$ the following identity holds:
\[\int_{\vec w\in \S M}f(\vec w)
=
\int_{\vec u\in \S^+ \partial M} 
\int_0^{\ell(\vec u)} f[\gamma'_{\vec u}(t)]\cdot\langle\vec u,\vec n\rangle\cdot dt,\]
where $\vec n$ denotes the unit vector field normal to $\partial M$ that points inside~$M$ and $\gamma_{\vec u}$ denotes the geodesic in $M$ defined by $\gamma'_{\vec u}=\vec u$.

In particular, by taking $f\equiv 1$, we get
\[\vol\SSS^{n-1}\cdot\vol M=\int_{\vec u\in \S^+ \partial M} \ell(\vec u)\cdot\langle\vec u,\vec n\rangle.\]

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Construct two Reimannian metrics $g_0$ and $g_1$ on the disc $\DD$ that coincide near the boundary and such that 
\[\area (\DD,g_0)>\area (\DD,g_1),\]
but 
\[\ell_0(\vec u)<\ell_1(\vec u),\]
where $\ell_i(\vec u)$ denotes hitting time of $g_i$-geodesic in the direction $\vec u$;
that is, 
$\ell_i(\vec u)$ is the length of $g_i$-geodesic that starts at a point $p\in \partial \DD$ in the direction $\vec u\in \S^+ \partial \DD$.

Why does this example not contradict Santal\'{o} formula?
\end{thm}

\section{More exercises}

Two Riemannian metrics $g_0$ and $g_1$ on $M$ are called \emph{conformally equivalent} if there is a function $\lambda$ such that $g_1=\lambda^2\cdot g_0$.
In this case the function $\lambda$ is called \emph{conformal factor}.
Note that for any $g_0$-unit-speed curve $\gamma\:[a,b]\to M$ 
we have
\[\length_{g_1}\gamma=\int_a^b\lambda\circ\gamma(t)\cdot dt\]

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $g_0$ be the canonical metric on the projective space $\RP^n$; 
that is, $(\RP^n,g_0)$ is isometric to the quotient space of the unit sphere $\SSS^n$ by central symmetry.
Suppose that $g_1$ is conformally equivalent to $g_0$.
Denote by $\ell_0$ and $\ell_1$ the \emph{systoles} --- the lengths of shortest noncontractible closed curves in $(\RP^n,g_0)$ and $(\RP^n,g_1)$ respectively (so $\ell_0=\pi$).
Show that 
\[\frac{\vol(\RP^n,g_1)}{\ell_1^n}\ge \frac{\vol(\RP^n,g_0)}{\ell_0^n}.\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Hint:} Use that geodesic flow preserves volume of the unit tangent bundle to rewrite the integral of conformal factor over $(\RP^n,g_0)$ and interpret the result.

\bigskip

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold.
The Sasaki metric is a natural choice of Riemannian metric $\hat g$ on the total space of the tangent bundle $\tau\:\T M\to M$ defined the following way:

Identify the tangent space 
$\T_u[\T M]$ for any $u\z\in \T_p M$ with the direct sum of vertical and horizontal subspaces $\T_p M\z\oplus \T_p M$.
The projection of this splitting is defined by the differential $d\tau\:\T\T M\to \T M$
and we assume that the velocity of a curve in $\T M$ formed by a parallel field along a curve in $M$ is horizontal.
Then $\T_u[\T M]$ is equipped with the metric $\hat g$ defined by
\[\hat g(X,Y)=g(X^V,Y^V)+g(X^H,Y^H),\]
where $X^V$ and $X^H\in\T_pM$ denote the vertical and horizontal components of $X\in\T_u[\T M]$.



\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $g$ be the canonical Riemannian metric on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$.
Consider the tangent bundle $\T \mathbb{S}^2$ 
equipped with the induced Sasaki metric $\hat g$.
Let $S_R$ be the hypersurface in $\T \mathbb{S}^2$ of vectors with norm $R$;
we assume that $S_R$ is equipped with induced Riemannian metric.

Show that $\vol S_R\to \infty$ as $R\to\infty$,
but $\diam S_R$ stays bounded for all $R$.
\end{thm}

\item For regions in hyperbolic spaces; it follows from the result of Gérard Besson, Gilles Courtois, and Sylvestre Gallot \cite{besson-courtois-gallot-1995}.
\item For regions in the product space $\RR\times M$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold with unique geodesic between any two points; proved by Christopher Croke and Bruce Kleiner \cite{croke-kleiner-1998}.
